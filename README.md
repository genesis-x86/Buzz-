# Buzz!

A simple low level programming language for the woodpecker cpu.

Buzz! is basic and very close to the original machine instructions provided by Kaizen security. 
The added benefits of Buzz! are operation functions, variables and n(operation) loops.

The purpose of Buzz! is to act as a middle language between the machine instructions and a higher level language.
